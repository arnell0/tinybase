# TinyBase
Welcome to Tinybase, your compact yet powerful open-source alternative to Firebase. Tinybase is all about simplicity, efficiency, and local control, packing all the features you need while keeping everything streamlined. Our project embodies the philosophy that less is more, delivering a one-file solution for all your backend needs.

## Project Description:
Tinybase takes the complexity out of database management, offering a minimalist yet feature-rich approach. This project consists of two main components: the backend, called "base" and the frontend, known as "tiny". Here's a closer look at what makes Tinybase stand out:

### Backend ("base"):
- Built with Rust and Axum: The heart of Tinybase is built in Rust, a language known for its efficiency and safety. Axum, a modern asynchronous web framework, powers the backend, ensuring robust performance and security.

- SQLite Database: Tinybase relies on a file-based SQLite database, which guarantees data durability and efficient queries. The choice of SQLite keeps your data local, making it an ideal solution for those who prioritize privacy and data ownership.

- Simple Yet Powerful: Tinybase doesn't compromise on features. It offers all the essential functionalities you'd expect in a database system, without the unnecessary bloat. This simplicity makes Tinybase easy to understand, manage, and extend.

- Automated Forms: Tinybase simplifies data insertion with automatic form generation. Even users with no database experience can effortlessly input data, reducing the learning curve and accelerating your project's development.

### Frontend ("tiny"):
- Preact Framework: The frontend is built using Preact, a lightweight alternative to React. This ensures a fast and responsive user interface while keeping your project's footprint small.

- Just-Table Component: Tinybase leverages the Just-Table component, streamlining the presentation of tabular data. This integration ensures your data is presented in an organized and user-friendly manner.

- AUI UX Library: The AUI UX library further enhances the user experience, providing a polished and intuitive interface that your users will love.

Tinybase's strength lies in its simplicity, locality, and ease of deployment. Whether you're a solo developer or a small team, Tinybase simplifies your database management, offering a local alternative to cloud-based services. Experience the power of Tinybase today and unlock the full potential of your projects while keeping them lean and efficient.
